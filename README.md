The bundle provides a new `cleeng` service that returns an instance of
`Cleeng_Api`.

## Installation

    <?php
    // app/AppKernel.php

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Hirviid\Bundle\CleengBundle\HirviidCleengBundle(),
            // ...
        );
    }

That's it! You are ready to use Cleeng with symfony2.
